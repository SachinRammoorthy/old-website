              The Butterfly Effect

Robert Peterson emerged like a butterfly from a cocoon out of a fiery storm. As he walked out unscathed, people started to ask questions. Who is this man? How did he just materialize out of nowhere? Robert ignored the bewildered looks.

What seemed to be most disturbing though, was that the shrieking storm ended just as it started - right after the strange man in the black cloak walked out of it. The Arizona desert was void of any clouds 30 seconds later.

Robert made his way to the nearest structure - a small 7-Eleven in the distance. He walked straight through the wall, only to emerge out of a portal that appeared out of thin air in New York City. He made his way through the borough of Brooklyn, all the way to Manhattan. The huge buildings loomed through the dense fog of the morning. He had never been to New York before.

Soon, he reached his destination - a small diner called ‘The Food Shack’ wedged in between two giant buildings. His mission report had provided a picture of the restaurant, but it looked so much smaller compared to its neighbors.

Robert entered through the small door. His muscular frame could barely fit through. He scanned the tables and found his target. Right on time. The man’s name was Shaquille O’Neal. Everybody knew Shaq. He was once a very famous basketball player. He was biting into his grilled cheese sandwich, with extra cheese.

Robert sat opposite Shaquille - who was obviously puzzled. He was disguised in order to prevent being swarmed by fans.
“Can I help you?”, asked Shaq.
“Mr O’Neal, my name is Robert Peterson. It is very important that you listen to me. The world’s fate could depend on it.”
“What? How did you recognize me? Do not tell anybody it’s me! I cannot handle the stress. Please leave me to my sandwich.”
“Mr O’Neal, I don’t think you understand. I am from the future.”
“Mr Peterson! Please get out, before I make you!”
“OK. In a minute, a waitress by the name of Shelly will come out of the kitchen with a platter of food. She will trip over this fold in the mattress. It is of utmost importance that you catch her!”

Without another word, Robert got up and left, leaving Shaq even more disturbed.
“What a weird incident!”, Shaq thought to himself.

Then, as had been predicted by Robert, a waitress emerged from the kitchen. Even though her name tag was not very clear to him, Shaq knew with certainty that it read ‘Shelly’. She had not seen the fold in the mattress. Then, the waitress tripped over it. Without hesitating, Shaq threw his big body forward and caught her, right before she hit the ground.

As she thanked him profusely, Shaq wondered how the weird man who he just met knew that this was going to happen.

Little did he know that he had just prevented the world from ending. The butterfly effect -  the phenomenon where one small action would result in cascading effects elsewhere - would have led to a sequence of events all stemming from this one moment.

Had he not caught Shelly, she would have hit the ground and food from her platter would have splattered the man sitting at the corner table. He, in turn, would produce the gun that he had concealed in his jacket and threaten to shoot her. The police would arrive in exactly 2 minutes and 17 seconds. Out of fear for his life, the man would take all the diners of ‘the Food Shack’ hostage.

The police would try to shoot the man, but would hit a diner instead. Alarmed that he was being shot at, the man would shoot all his hostages and make a break for it. He would soon be caught, however, 18 people had been killed, including Shaquille O’Neal!

News of Shaq’s death would spark a small scale protest, which would gradually grow to a large revolt. Why had the police not responded in the right way? This revolt would go on to gain international attention, and all around the world, people would protest. Their demand - for the police to be disembodied (and for Shaq to be back!).
In 6 months, the governments of many countries would be forced to disembody the police forces to satisfy the rebellion. But without the police, anarchy would break out. Crime was never higher. Everything shut down. Millions died everyday because of lack of health care and food. Soon, everybody would be at each other's throats, fighting for what they thought was theirs. This would mark the end of the world.

Utopia had just been saved from becoming Dystopia.
