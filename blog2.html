              During the summer of 2016, my family and I visited Japan. In addition to the impressive temples and advanced technology, we were intrigued by the Japanese culture. We found that the people there were extremely kind and helpful.
<br><br>
Even with the language barrier, people went out of their way to help us on several separate occasions. I am reminded of one specific event that really gave me an superior impression of the people in Japan.
<br><br>
Japan is the land of seafood, which may sound appealing to the average person, but this is actually a vegetarian’s worst nightmare. My family and I do not eat meat, and surviving in Japan proved to be an ordeal.
<br><br>
On one particular day when we were hunting for vegetarian food, we came across a restaurant that served tempuras (the Japanese equivalent of pakoras), a dish whose vegetarian version we had had before in a Japanese restaurant elsewhere. We were wondering if the restaurant served vegetarian tempuras, but were futile in our efforts of questioning a waiter.
<br><br>
An old Japanese lady who was was walking past noticed our situation. She hardly knew any English herself, but decided that it was her moral duty to sort it out. She approached us and asked, “What want?”. My father slowly replied, “We are vegetarians. Could you please ask the waiter if they have vegetarian food available?”.
<br><br>
It was quite obvious that the lady did not understand one single word of what my father. Undaunted, she called on another random person walking in the mall, and had a rapid conversation with him. He turned towards us and politely said, “What you want?”. This time, my father was more careful. He replied, “We no eat meat. No chicken, no fish”, frantically outlining a cross with his hands the whole time.
<br><br>
Apparently, the man understood what my dad said. He seemed to know what we were looking for. He hurriedly explained everything to the waiter, and even wrote something on a scrap piece of paper and gave it to us. “For next time”, he said.
<br><br>
With everything resolved, we thanked both the old lady and the man profusely. They smiled and said “Mondainai”, which I later learned meant “No problem” in Japanese. The waiter led us inside, and we had some delicious vegetarian tempuras for lunch.
